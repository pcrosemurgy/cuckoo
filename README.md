# Cuckoo
A Raspberry Pi cat GIF alarm clock that grabs the most recent cat GIF's from GIPHY and plays them immediately after the alarm goes off. This repository includes custom OpenSCAD files for the 3D-printed enclosure, UI, and touch gesture functionality. Pyglet is used for rendering and Cron for scheduling the alarm.
